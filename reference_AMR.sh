# Step 2: Parse and filter BLAST results
# You can parse and filter the BLAST results based on criteria like e-value, percent identity, and coverage.

# Example: Filter results with an e-value cutoff of 1e-10 and percent identity of 90%
awk -F'\t' '$11 <= 1e-10 && $3 >= 90 && $4 >= 90' "$output_directory/blast_results.txt" > "$output_directory/filtered_blast_results.txt"

# Step 3: View or further analyze the filtered results
# You can analyze the filtered results to identify specific AMR genes present in your genome.
