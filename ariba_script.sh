ariba prepareref -f "$ariba_db" "$ariba_db"

# Step 2: Run Ariba to scan for AMR genes
ariba run "$ariba_db" "$genome_fasta" "$output_directory"

# Step 3: View AMR gene results
# Ariba generates HTML and JSON reports in the output directory with detailed results.

# Optional: Generate a summary report
ariba summary "$output_directory" > amr_summary.txt

# Optional: Filter results for specific AMR genes or thresholds
# You can filter the JSON results as needed for specific genes or resistance profiles.

# Optional: Visualize results or create custom reports based on the JSON output.
# Custom scripts or tools can be used to parse and visualize AMR gene results.
